# OpenLists

OpenLists is a collection of lists that curates open resources and materials for a set of topics. 

## List of OpenLists

The collection of OpenLists includes:

- [Python Resources](https://github.com/openlists/PythonResources)
- [Git Resources](https://github.com/openlists/GitResources)
- [Digital Signal Processing Resources](https://github.com/openlists/DSPResources)
- [Open Electrophysiological Data](https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologyData)
- [Open Electrophysiological Software](https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologySoftware)
- [Open Task Software & Resources](https://github.com/openlists/OpenTasks)
- [NeuroOntologies](https://github.com/openlists/NeuroOntologies)
- [Other Lists](https://github.com/openlists/OtherLists)

## Overview

The idea behind 'OpenLists' is that though there are a lot of available resources for learning and doing open science, sometimes it can be difficult to know where to start, and/or how to find and navigate materials that are available. To try and help with that, OpenLists is a collection of resources that we have found useful for learning and doing certain tasks, and/or finding available tools, data and resources. 

The 'OpenLists' collections are focused on open materials. By 'open', it means that anything listed in these collections is openly available, without cost to the user. This means that everything listed is open-access and/or open-source, and (where applicable) they should all have permissive licenses for re-use.

Note that being included in an OpenList collection is not meant as an official endorsement, nor does it imply that we have systematically validated each resource.

## Scope

The idea for the scope of 'OpenLists' is to cover science & computation. The original collections are focused on relevant resources for open science and computation driven work in cognitive neuroscience, with a focus on electrophysiology (based on the original contributors). Other links and lists are welcome, though the goal shall remain to serve the community do computation driven and open science work, and to list and collect resources not already well collected & curated by other resources.

## Contributing

The 'OpenLists' collections welcome contributions and suggestions from the community!

If you would to contribute or recommend a listing in any of the existing lists, or report any kind of issue with a listed item, please just open an issue on Github, on the relevant repo, and/or open a pull request with the suggested update.

We are also open to adding new lists of materials, or linking to existing collections. For that, please open an issue on this repository. 

Note that to interact with the OpenLists organization you must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openlists/Overview/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
